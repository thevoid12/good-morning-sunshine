Tailwind CSS  without using npm or a CDN. This approach is more manual but can be done. Here's how you can do it: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/content-configuration

Download Tailwind CSS directly:

Visit the Tailwind CSS GitHub releases page (https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases) and download the latest standalone CLI version for your operating system.

Rename and move the downloaded file:

Rename the file to tailwindcss (or tailwindcss.exe on Windows) and move it to your project directory.

Create a configuration file:

Create a file named tailwind.config.js in your project root with the following content:
javascriptCopymodule.exports = {
  content: [
    "./templates/**/*.{html,gohtml,tmpl}",
    "./static/**/*.{html,js}"
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}

Create an input CSS file:

Create a file named input.css in your project root with the following content:
cssCopy@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

Generate the CSS:

Run the following command in your terminal from your project root:
Copy./tailwindcss -i input.css -o static/output.css
This will generate the output.css file in your static directory.

Update your HTML templates:

In your Go HTML templates, include the generated CSS file:
htmlCopy<link href="/static/output.css" rel="stylesheet">

Serve static files in your Go application:

Make sure your Go server is set up to serve static files:
goCopyhttp.Handle("/static/", http.StripPrefix("/static/", http.FileServer(http.Dir("static"))))

For development:

To watch for changes and rebuild CSS automatically, you can use this command:
Copy./tailwindcss -i input.css -o static/output.css --watch

For production:

When building for production, use the --minify flag to minimize the CSS file size:
Copy./tailwindcss -i input.css -o static/output.css --minify
This approach allows you to use Tailwind CSS without npm or a CDN. However, keep in mind that you'll need to manually update the Tailwind CSS executable when new versions are released.
